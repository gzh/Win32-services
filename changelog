## 0.2.1

* bug fix: Services were failing to enter a STOPPED state. It is now the
  user's responsibility to enter a stopped state in the service main function.
  The 'startServiceCtrlDispatcher' function will continue to automatically put
  the service into a START_PENDING state.

## 0.2

* Writing services of the WIN32_OWN_PROCESS type is now easier. Handler
  registration is performed automatically. By the time the service main
  function is entered, the service will already be in the 'START_PENDING'
  state. It is the user's responsibility to enter the 'RUNNING' state as soon
  as possible.

* Once the service main function exits two things will occur. The service
  will enter the 'STOPPED' state, and the handler function will be freed.

* The 'registerServiceCtrlHandlerEx' function is no longer
  exported. Handlers are registered automatically by the
  'startServiceCtrlDispatcher' function.

* The 'queryServiceStatus' function has been added.
